# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

# 1. My process was to see what line the code was failing and then go investigate the errors.  
# 

# 2. It initially took me some jumping from file to file to see where everything was located.  It was 
# also difficult to trust everything would work initially without running the tests.  After playing around with it, it became easier and easier to spot and fix.

# 3 Learning about debugging and how to spot which line has the error.  Something that would have helped me achieve this quicker is having more practice and more knowledge on pry.
